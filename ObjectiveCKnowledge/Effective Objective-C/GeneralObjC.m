//  Objective-c messaging structure with dynamic binding: The runtime decides which code gets executed as opposed to the compiler.

#import "GeneralObjC.h"

//  This should replace #define INTERNAL_INT because the static const has a type and any other class that imports the header file on which the #define is declared, will replace INTERNAL_INT as well.
//  k is a suffix to indicate that the constant is locally declared. If it's a global constant, the prefix should be the class name and the declaration will be moved to the .h file. Only expose the constants that MUST be exposed.
//  It's important that the variable is static and const. Const means that the compiler won't allow someone else to try to modify its value and static means that the symbol will be created in the generated .o file as opposed to in a global symbol table, which can avoid a "duplicate symbols" compile crash. Saying so, it will only replace the local occurences of kInternalInt with the 0 value as the #define would do but with the correct type instead.
static const int kInternalInt = 0;

//  The declaration is read backwards meaning that this is a constant pointer to a string, meaning that this pointer cannot point to a different string.
//  Because there is no static modifier, this symbol will be created in the global symbol table.
